# Implementing-SRTF-with-C++

Instructions:
● Ask the user for the number of processes to input, n.
● Then take user input for each of the n processes:
ProcessName, ArrivalTime and BurstTime.
● Show the scheduling sequence using SRTF along
with the Timeline.
Output Example: P1(0-4) P2(4-6) P1(6-8)...................

● Calculate the Waiting Time for each process and
show them.
● Finally calculate the Average Waiting Time.
